Here you will find few of the configuration which I use in my Linux system. You can tailor it according it to your needs.

.alias - Useful alias file of commonly used UNIX commands.
.global_ignore - Global git ignore rules.
In order to use .alias script, just clone that in your $HOME directory and place the following command in your ~/.bashrc file.
source ~/.alias

For using the .emacs file, put that under your $HOME directory.

For using the .global_ignore file, put that under your $HOME directory and issue the following command:
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.global_ignore

For setting up Emacs IDE:

1) Put .emacs and .emacs.d under your HOME directory.
2) Setup Auto-completion
   * cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor/auto-complete-1.3.1/
   * make byte-compile
3) Setup Pymacs
   * cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor/pinard-Pymacs-016b0bc/
   * make
   * sudo make install
4) Setup Yasnippet
   * cd ~/.emacs.d/
   * ln -s ./vendor/capitaomorte-yasnippet-66e804d/snippets/ .
