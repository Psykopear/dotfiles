Here you will find few of the configuration which I use in my Linux system. You can tailor it according it to your needs.

.alias - Useful alias file of commonly used UNIX commands.
.emacs - Emacs configuration file for specific customization.

In order to use .alias script, just clone that in your $HOME directory and place the following command in your ~/.bashrc file.
source ~/.alias
